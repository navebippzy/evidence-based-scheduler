# Evidence-Based Scheduler

A task management app based on the idea of [Evidence-Based Scheduling](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
